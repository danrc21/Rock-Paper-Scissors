# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Udacity Project: Create a Rock Paper Scissors game that allows users to play against 3 different computer players.
One play only plays rock. The second player remembers your moves from the previous turn and plays them on the new turn. The third player remembers its moves from the previous turn and alternates between rock, paper or scissors.
